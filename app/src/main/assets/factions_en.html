<td><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Factions</b><br>
<br>
The world of <b>LordsWM</b> is populated by a great number
of races and creatures. Lords of every faction have their unique
features and control certain creatures. That is why, it is very
important for the player to choose the most appropriate faction when
beginning to play. Note that the character’s faction can be changed
nearly anytime in your castle.
<br>
<br>
<b>Knights</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r1.png" height="15" width="15">
<br>
<font color="red">Holy knight</font>
<img src="./factions_en_files/r101.png" height="15" width="15"> (alternative class, available
at CL 5.)
<br>
A very discrepant and one of the most short-living factions populating
the Empire lands. While possessing rather weak magic, knights rely upon
their physical strength and tactical planning. They use all kinds of
cold steel skillfully, and their creatures' characteristics are
relatively balanced and useful both in attack and defense. This
universality often grants them victory in a majority of fights; however
it requires a strategic mind. If you are a tactician by nature and
prefer shrewdness and acute mind to brute force, then become a knight.
<br>
<br>
<i>Namely people have brought the idea of
betrayal, greediness and pettiness into the world of Lords of
W&amp;M. However, though other factions show unconcealed dislike
for knights, the fact remains that they are a force to be taken into
account.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Necromancers</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r2.png" height="15" width="15">
<br>
<font color="red">Unholy necromancer</font>
<img src="./factions_en_files/r102.png" height="15" width="15"> (alternative class, available
at CL 5.)
<br>
An ancient and mighty faction, the undead forces make even the most
experienced warriors' blood run cold. Their strong side is melee fight
where an accent is made on attack. Being lords of death and masters of
dark arts, necromancers possess such unique abilities as raising the
dead and vampirism. The morale doesn’t apply to dead beings: it is
impossible to encourage them by the prospective of victory nor to scare
them with death. For beginners and those who hesitate about their
choice, necromancers are a perfect faction.
<br>
<br>
<i>The number and influence of servants of
darkness are constantly growing. Turning their enemies to dust and
ashes, necromancers inexorably pursue their main goal – to become the
most powerful force of this world.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Wizards</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r3.png" height="15" width="15"><br>
<font color="red">Battlewise wizard</font>
<img src="./factions_en_files/r103.png" height="15" width="15"> (alternative class, available
at CL 5.)
<br>
Wizards are proud knowledge hunters, intending to seize in control the
orders of the universe. Their society devoted itself to wisdom and
knowledge. Wizards spend their lives studying and describing occult
sciences. They rule over creatures who serve them and whom they either
have summoned or brought to life with the help of magic. Their warriors
are particularly strong in defense, and the magical spells of this
faction are nearly the strongest. However, the combat strength of the
wizards directly depends on the quantity of mana; lacking it can
sometimes greatly restrain their actions. Wizard faction is perfect for
patient players who like to play in defense, preferring to eliminate
enemy’s troops on approach.
<br>
<br>
<i>Wizards consider themselves to be a
dominating race on the Empire lands. They don’t believe in the
existence of supreme beings and think that, if enough energy in
conducting research and experiments is spent, one can achieve
capabilities of Gods by oneself.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Elves</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r4.png" height="15" width="15"><br>
<font color="red">Charmer Elf</font>
<img src="./factions_en_files/r104.png" height="15" width="15"> (alternative class, available
at CL 5.)
<br>
The representatives of this faction, often called first-born, are by
rights considered to be the oldest and the wisest inhabitants of the
Lords of W&amp;M world. They spend the major part of their lives in
forests where there is no need in force; the main thing is a good bow
and keen eye. Nature endowed them one of the biggest values of
initiative in the game, and their racial skill - favored enemy, that
increases the chance of dealing critical damage, makes them very
dangerous rivals at range. Elvish faction is mostly chosen by calm and
steady players who enjoy creative and defensive style of the game.
<br>
<br>
<i>Elves are beautiful and patient and live in
close harmony with the Earth. They always follow their oldest
traditions and are often thought of as unsociable, proud and absorbed
by their problems.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Barbarians</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r5.png" height="15" width="15">
<br>
<font color="red">Fury barbarian</font>
<img src="./factions_en_files/r105.png" height="15" width="15"> (alternative class, available
CL 5.)
<br>
<font color="red">Shadow barbarian</font>
<img src="./factions_en_files/r205.png" height="15" width="15"> (alternative class, available
at CL 5.)
<br>
Barbarians kept the foundations of their culture from ancient times to
this day nearly unchanged. Might and swiftness are the basis of their
nation. Perfect health and continuous perfection of their combat skills
have always been the keystone to success. While possessing excellent
attacking potential, they are liable to disorder and for that reason
often lose when staying in defense. This faction fits mostly for
implacable and aggressively disposed players.
<br>
<br>
<i>Nowadays, barbarians have to put up with
living in the neighborhood with other races, however, the traditions of
these warriors emphasize their indisputable superiority, so they will
always struggle for domination.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Dark Elves</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r6.png" height="15" width="15">
<br>
<font color="red">Tamer Dark Elves</font>
<img src="./factions_en_files/r106.png" height="15" width="15"> (alternative class, available
at CL 5.)
<br>
While their origin and history are covered with obscurity, it is known
that Dark Elves were separated from the main Elvish race a long time
ago. Having turned evil, they settled down in the subterranean world, a
huge system of caves, grottos, passages and tunnels of both natural and
artificial origin that stretches beneath all of the Empire's lands. On
the battlefield, dark warriors favour hit-and-run attacks by small but
strong groups, supported by skilful magicians. Their way of life may be
summed up as "everyone at war with everyone else", and as such,
self-confidence and a knack for scheming are typical for players who
choose to play for this faction.
<br>
<br>
<i>Arrogant, naturally sly and unprincipled,
dark elves are gradually capturing the subterranean world, however,
more and more power gained, their looks often turn to the surface in
search of dominion…</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Demons</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r7.png" height="15" width="15">
<br>
<font color="red">Darkness demon</font>
<img src="./factions_en_files/r107.png" height="15" width="15"> (alternative class, available
at CL 5.)
<br>
Monsters of the underworld that fight for chaos, bloodshed and
suffering during all their lives. The demon faction is hostile towards
everything that lives. Their warriors are known for mindless cruelty on
the battlefield, and their unique magic abilities allow them to call
reinforcements from Inferno itself and bring down the fury of fire
right upon their enemies. In battles, demon players are supposed to
combine attacks with the assist of magic.
<br>
<br>
<i>Demons are willing to burn the universe to
ashes and plunge tormented world into everlasting darkness and
destruction. Once this faction has already managed to occupy large
territories of the Empire, but later the Inferno forces have been
thrown back. A group of demons led by charismatic and authoritative
leader, noble Arabat Flamesoul IV, broke off from the demonic Infernals
and joined the Empire, providing great insight on their race for the
Empire to cope with in future, and themselves becoming a considerable
addition to the Empire military in all impending conflicts.</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Dwarves</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r8.png" height="15" width="15">
	<br><font color="red">Fire Dwarf</font> <img src="factions_en_files/r108.png" width="15" height="15"></b> (alternative class, available at <a href="help.php?section=8">CL</a> 5.) <br>
Dwarves are well known for their endurance that allows this hardy race
to hold fast against any charge. They are renowned for being masters of
magic although they prefer to tussle. In particular there’s a specific
type of magic that dwarves excel at - Rune magic. Possession of a
variety of runes allow dwarves to overcome almost any obstacles to
secure their victory.<br>
These rough-bearded men aren’t talkative and won’t be on rush
considering everything carefully before action. Dwarves are outstanding
warriors who can teach us much but about who so little is known. They
jealously guard their secrets and probably because of this they don’t
appreciate strangers.<br>
<br>
<i>Although Dwarves became a part of our
glorious Empire, somewhere deep in their hearts they still remain a
proud unruly and independent race and never turn away from any
challenge… even if that challenge is to dominate the Empire!</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>Tribals</b> <img src="./factions_en_files/r9.png" height="15" width="15">
<br>
Tribals are the true children of battle, highly spiritual and
steadfast. Grown and hardened away from civilization in distant
steppes, they rely only on brute force multiplied by their common
spirit, and trifles like politeness, etiquette and many other are alien
to them. Their main combat principle is to act without delay, crushing
everything in their path, sacrificing the weak in the name of the
strong ones' cherishing; their spiritualism, however, keeps them just
and dedicated to any goal they set in front of themselves.<br>
<br>
<i>The Tribals fled from the tyranny of their
crazed and corrupted khan, and were forced to request help from the
Empress whom they once marched against under his rule. But their spirit
isn't broken, their thirst for battle is stronger than ever. For they
have a new purpose now, they intend to earn a decent position among the
Empire's inhabitants, grow in numbers and multiply strength, and then
one day fulfill what was foretold by the spirits: destroy the khan and
his corrupt rule and glorify the spiritual culture of their tribe.</i></td>
