<td><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Special
abilities</b><br>
<br>
Barbarian characters and most creatures possess special abilities.
Abilities can be passive, generic, triggering or activated.<br>
Passive and generic ones function without player participation; the
former have permanent effect, the latter occur on certain creature
actions.<br>
<font color="green"><b>†&nbsp;</b>Triggering
abilities</font> may trigger during any attack. The probability
of triggering depends on HP of damager and target.<br>
If DHP &#8805; THP, then<br>
<font color="blue">Probability = 25% +
3% * (DHP/THP);</font><br>
else<br>
<font color="blue">Probability = 25% -
3% * (THP/DHP)</font><br>
where:<br>
» DHP is the total remaining HP of the damaging stack;<br>
» THP is the total remaining HP of the target stack;<br>
» Trigger probability lays within the interval of [5%;75%];<br>
» The moments to calculate the probability differ depending on the
ability type.<br>
-For <b>Fatal blow</b>, <b>Knocking shot</b>
and <b>Stun</b>, the probability is calculated using HP's
of stacks <u>before</u> the actual attack.<br>
-For <b>Blinding brilliance</b>, <b>Fear attack</b>,
<b>Knockback</b>, <b>Mayhem</b>,
<b>Shadow whip</b>, <b>Thunderbolt</b>
and <b>Unruly</b>, the calculation occurs <u>after</u>
the attack and before target's retaliation;<br>
» <b>Blinding brilliance</b>, <b>Knockback</b>,
<b>Mayhem</b>, <b>Shadow whip</b>
and <b>Thunderbolt</b> can also trigger on retaliation
strikes. If blinding brilliance triggers on retaliation, it interrupts
any attacker's actions supposed to occur after their strike (e.g. such
abilities as Strike and return, Triple strike etc.)
<br>
<font color="red"><b>&#945;&nbsp;</b>Activated
abilities</font> require player action, usually activating this
ability consumes the creature's turn. Click the <a href="http://www.lordswm.com/help.php?section=16">"Spell/Ability"</a>
button to activate an ability. Specify the target or the area for that
ability on the battlefield. In order to cancel usage of an activated
ability, click the "Spell/Ability" button once more.<br>
<br>
In the list below, creatures are often divided into commanded, allied,
friendly and hostile.
<li>Commanded creatures are those under your
command. Unless participating in a special event, or casting
controlling abilities, they normally belong to the faction you are
currently playing.
</li>
<li>Friendly creatures belong to your team but
are not under your control. As an example, they may belong to your
teammate in a 2vs2 group battle.
</li>
<li>Allied creatures are jointly commanded and
friendly ones, thus, all those who belong to your combat party.
</li>
<li>Hostile or enemy creatures are all other,
those that all your troops are generally able to attack and deal damage
to.<br>
